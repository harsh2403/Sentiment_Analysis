By the way a I didn't used it for more time time, I returned it on the same day when I received. So I have no comments on on other portions. But I noticed that the steps tracker updates lately. It is not a step by step update, it is updating in its own time intervals which was not expected in this conventional wristbands of today's market.",2

1229,"I gave this a try as dettol antiseptic was not available. Not sure about effectiveness. But unlike dettol, water turns orange in colour upon using savlon and cant be used for laundry especially for white clothes. It doesnt stain clothes but gives a very mild peachy tint. Coming to scent, i read some reviews where it was mentioned that smell is better than dettol. But i  dont feel the difference.  In fact i prefer dettol smell, may be because we were using it since long..",4

I tried setting the timer on 10,20 and 40min intervals but it sprays within seconds. Can‚Äôt even return the product now because it is out of return window. The fragnance is pretty good but can‚Äôt believe that the machinery of this product have timer issues in just less than a month of use. Totally not recommended if you are bot looking to buy this product every month.",1
1419,Good product and smell is nice,5
1159,To be honestly i have been using regular brown colour antiseptic liquid and i loved it so i thought to buy lemon scent liquid in hope that it will be much good than last one.

Don't buy dont go on reviews.. I was purchased on reviews too.. U will regret once u use.. scent 2/10Thickness 2/10..really dont buy dont waste ur money on lemon.. Buy brown liquid,1

318,"I love this digital safe locker. Now I can put all my important stuff inside this box. The good thing is that it is not that bulky. The material is also very good, seems very strong and heavy. And, It is very easy to install. I have not mounted/fixed it because I put this inside the almera. Now I can feel safer by keeping cash, passport and other valuable stuff.Lookwise also it just has a classy touch. It has a proper colored LED display. It works on the battery power and the consumption is very low. You can set your own passcode from the 4-8 digits. I like it beep sound whenever you have to press the keys. In addition it also has 2 emergency keys. Overall now I am very calm ever since this digital safe has been arrived. Of course now I can manage my things for my own peace of mind according to my needs :-).Earlier I never ever used such kind of digital safe but after have been started using¬† this I found this as exactly as what I expected for.

676,"you should not label a product as ""Natural Juice"" if it is a mixture of some juice with water and sugar and other flavorings including artificial flavors.  It doesn't taste badly but for anyone who bought it thinking it was going to be a liter of Natural Mango Juice, it is a very disappointing experience.  Why not be honest??",2

67,Ubtan Facewash- made from Turmeric and Liqurice Extract. Was excited to use as heard first time about facewash of Ubtan. Helps in removing dead cells and gives a glow on skin. Very helpful product to repair sun damage and tan and to protect your skin from tanning.,5
2124,The packet was torn... Strange flavour. Not like the original.,1
786,A good ghee is granular and thick. This one is more like oil on top and looks granular in the bottom of the bottle. Disappointing as it neither has the flavour or taste of a ‚Äòshush ghee‚Äô,2

2138,Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. It's great as a black tea as well. Just don't boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.,5

2230,"Reviewing CTC tea can be tricky: everyone has their own preferences. Flavour profiles that one has become accustomed to often determines how one reacts to a new tea.For the purpose of making milk tea,  this particular brand is quite good: a strong combination of good colour, definitely pleasing fragrance and taste that's firm but not too overpowering.This is a good option for someone used to tee leaves made by the likes of Wagh Bakri. This has slightly more liquor to it than the Wagh Bakhri and the fragrance spectrum is a bit wider.If you're the type who likes your Tata Agni and similar robust and bolder tea leaves then this may not be what you're looking for.It's price point is on the higher side and may be a factor for many. That said,  if you enjoy that one good cup a day,  it's a worthy buy-in.My recommendation: certainly worth a try especially if you like a good,  developed flavour in your cuppa.",4

Sturdy enough to dissuade servants from physical tampering. Serves purpose for what it is intended to do.",5

194,I avoided the previous negative reviews for this item and trusted mama earth brand but I'm sharing this review after 2 weeks of use. On 1st day itself I got rashes on my skin but I ignored it. Later on my whole face got rashes and small boils. My skin became too dry and spotty. I used it with mama earth baby cream still my skin was drying out giving me many burns on face. I stopped using this item and continued my cetaphil cleansing lotion. I will never use mama earth's any product again. I threw away the soaps and moisturizer.,1

The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid.

175,I really love services of amazon their delivery their return policy their  packing.Their service towards their customers its applicable.Now product- 3.5 star  Average plus product. odour of the material i didn't like. It smells like medicated facewash. I dont know whether it fights with acne or pimple. I wasn't having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didn't know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI don't know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if you're suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.,4

The black dial and the silver hands and silver marking makes the functioning of the watch look stunning and royal. Dial size is just right. It is definitely not small and it is not very big either. It looks very well balanced on the wrist. And the metal bracelet that comes with it is beautiful and goes perfectly with the timepiece dimension wise and there's no mismatch between them.

2302,"If you really a teas fan, you definitely not being unaware of the TATA Tea family. Trusted brand from so many years. I tried almost every standard brand of Teas available in the market, but at last I can say that TATA Tea is the best available brand in the printed price. Although TATA Tea brand is already quite efficient in serving the purpose but the current addition of 'TATA Tea Gold' actually makes sense because of the quality enhancement by adding dried whole tea leaves in to the processed tea. Mixing of whole leaf resulted into the enhanced flavor & color of the prepared Tea. Not more concentrated not milder, it‚Äôs like a balanced golden color with real taste/flavor which designed exactly keeping in mind the expectation of the user.1. I agree that if you require strong color/flavor you need to add a little more leaves in to the preparation because TATA Tea Gold is not meant for people who like very strong color seekers. Its more workable for people who wants real flavor with natural golden color in the final preparation. Although even a single tea-spoon is enough to prepare a natural golden cup full of real tea.2. One may keep in mind before using that this tea contains real whole dry tea leaves, so it may take more 2 minutes in preparation in comparison with other brands and the reason is, it is without any added artificial colors into it. The whole dried tea leaves takes time to release real flavor of the contents.3. Taste is premium & up to the expectations as always.4. Packaging is good enough. Visual ergonomic principles well taken into consideration designing the same. Its smarter and visually appealing than the previous packs.I‚Äôm using this product from more than 2 years. So, its not an random review. In my family we are using this product in making of every single cup day and night 24x7, whenver we feel like to have one.",5

Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive & negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u don't find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open.

2256,"I was using Red label since ages and some time back switched to Tata Gold tea for some reason.I must say Tata gold is way cheaper and tests much batter than Red Label.Also quantity required to make a cup of tea is lesser compared to Red Label.These are my reasons to switch to Tata Gold:  1. Because of the controversial advertising by Red Label where they said that people go to Kumbh Mela to abandon  their old age parents. Thse MNCs come to India, make money from us and than mock us, this should not be tolerated.  2. To support Indian Brands like Tata, Patanjali, Dabur, etc.",5

2227,The quality of the item is not up to the mark. The flavor and the strong test that we (me & my family) found in local shops of ‚Çπ10 pack of this tea is missing here.This item is fully useless in case of making liquor tea(red tea). If less liquor is given the tea seems nothing but boiled water & if given more the tea becomes black. I got stuck with this 500gm tea.,1

Has a pleasant fragrance and recommended for all above 3 years.",5
188,"The soap is really good and I really appreciate its quality. It leaves baby's skin soft, moisturized and doesn't dry it out at all.

Mamaearth please do something about it without compromising on the quality.",5
170,I am writing this review after using it around 20 days. It seems very natural and chemical free and is very gentle on skin. But it does its job of cleaning the skin properly. It contains tea tree which is one of my favourite ingredients for skin care.

43,Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.,5

I was scared thinking the glass face must be damaged, but thank God it wasnt the case. Also there's no dealer stamp in the warranty card.My take: if you really like what you see, go for it.

Unlike the 400ml Himalaya gentle baby shampoo or gentle baby bath which has no seals, this lotion comes in clear laminated sealed pack and I've received it in good condition and packing all the 3 times I ordered. Although it's tad light it's okay for baby skin. I love it's fragrance, leaves my baby smelling nice and I use it myself too but it's too light for my dry skin,but of course it's meant mainly for babies.One winning feature about this particular 400ml pack is it's pump feature,makes it lot easier to literally use it singlehandedly which comes in real handy if you've to hold a squirming wriggling baby with your other hand!Update : I've ordered my 9th bottle!

When newly opened the fragrance is too strong that i would kick you in the face with it, but it dissolves when you give it a couple of days.Another good part about this is the concept of hanging it, I usually do in the fall ceiling of my washrooms, and it works pretty well.Word of caution: Don't expect it to last a month, because mine never have. Maximum 20 to 22 days, and then you'll want to replace it with a new one, but if you grab it on a deal on Amazon Pantry, it's quite economical",4

332,"The product was good. But starting it for the first time took me several hours to start and install it properly.Here I will list out all steps so that reading this other people might find it helpful.1. Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive & negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u don't find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open. Let the motor of the locker do its work.10. If the locker shows any other error message. Do consult the user manual.Note. Please be calm and do things properly or else you might damage the product.",4

This gives shine and makes ur hair soft but dont rely on this shampoo for removing oil from ur hair this is way mild for  that !,5
1044,Tried almost all Ghee brands available in the market but I always have to come back to Patanjali Ghee. I didn't find any other brand to give the same flavor and texture.,5
602,Best Mango Based Cool drink available in the market.Price is same as offline stores.,5
199,The soap is creamy and less foamy which means it is sulfate free and has fresh coconut fragrance . You will feel the difference in your babys skin the day you start using it. The packaging is Excellent!!! I give it more than five starts,5

289,The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it. If you have the shell to spend then go for it.,5
246,Itz lyk mysore Sandal.. But mysore Sandal comes only 10 to 13 days for my kids to bath.. But this soap come one month for the same usage.. Value for money,4

It has functionalities like distance, heart rate, Calorie, steps tracker Which are accurate and in time too. It displays only call And Whatsapp‚Äôs texts notifications ( I have connected my band to iphone so I have no idea if it performs differently when connected to Android smartphones). The battery life is almost 5 days if fully charged once! Sensors inside the watch work finely. This band helps to find the phone if lost. It tracks the sleep time as well which will be displayed on a phone. Hope this was helpful For you.",4

1293,"Very effective. Active ingredients are  quaternary ammonium chloride compounds which are a very potent and effective disinfectant - you can find these in most non-bleach disinfectant solutions. This is not the same as Dettol antiseptic used for skin so do not use it for that purpose. I am glad that Dettol introduced this as it was difficult to find purpose-made disinfectant concentrates of this formulation - the alternative was Amway Pursue which is not only much more expensive but would involve the hassle of dealing with a pushy Amway salesperson. Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance.",5

May be the product works for non-sensitive skin, product is really light, can‚Äôt tell if it gives any kind of moisture to the skin.

1222,Savlon liquid is a must for home. It is far better than so called Dettol as savlon has CHG and cetrimide. It has better efficacy against germs but the advertisement by HUL have made people sick so they buy dettol.It doesn't burn skin when applied on cuts / wound. Better smell. Also an Indian Product.,5

51,"My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties.

1027,Wonderful product. Using little produces enough lather.,5
218,Purchased 2 packs of 750ml each but surprised to see 1 full pack of 750ml filled into my pump dispenser of 650 ml capacity. To be noted my dispenser is an empty bottle of pantene shampoo having standard capacity. Sure about less volume of hand waah. One pack is still intact with its seal.

2662,"I bought this on a lark and it had been sitting on a shelf for a very long time. Till I developed warts on my chin. No amount of pulling and scrubbing helped and I was reluctant to use over-the-counter wart paint because of all the pharma warnings on them.I decided to use this clay on the warts, covering them with a generous coat of the clay twice a day and kept it on day and night for a month. Voila!I had to be patient but a month of application fixed my skin. Whatever this face pack contains, it is extremely effective. I used to a feel a constant sting after application but it can be ignored. The best part is that it didn't affect healthy skin adversely unlike wart paints which require precautions.Caution - These warts weren't because of an STD. I probably picked them up at the gym or some other place with too many people milling around in sweat. Please seek your doctor's advice if you have an STD. This face pack should not be applied on your eyelids or where you have a chance of ingesting it. Read disclaimers on the package.",5

New spray bottle comes with a cap, whereas old bottle comes without cap, which is discontinued by dettol.2. Most of the material inside is gas, very less quantity of alcohol.3. New spray pump has very less spray power(too weak) when compared to old one.4.

2148,Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong.

Boil the leaves only for masala chai.,5

1797,"The blue came out great! I have dark brown hair and bleached it twice (with volume 30 developer) before applying the colour. Left the colour on for 45-60 minutes. My hair (which felt very rough after bleaching) became much softer after rinsing off the colour. I also used the Crazy Violet (can see it in the pic). Have previously used Manic Panic hair colour which is 4 times the price, and a lot less effective. Would definitely recommend this range from Streax :D",5

109,"I bought it for my mom as she was having problems related to her skin like hyperpigmentation. Being in her 50s she has a well managed diet plan and routine. The package delivered was suitable and fine look wise. But, after applying on face for a week, her forehead started to develop rashes accompanied by itchiness. She had to literally stop it and wait till it heals which took  more than two weeks. Personally I would not recommend this product to any of the ladies out there. It's just a waste of money and time. And ofcourse, I won't get a refund or payback. I am surely disappointed, dissatisfied, and annoyed.",1

1362,"Highest 'TFM' content grade 1 soap. Recommended by the doctors.Though Nivea launched it's own soap flagship in india few days back which is in fact might have beaten cinthol in terms of quality.But for the price range,cinthol is the best.The quality of the soap is determined by its 'TFM' content which is almost same in nivea and cinthol but nivea also moisturizes the skin from within along with the cleansing.Anyways,both are the best soaps available in the market just with a little price differences.Please don't use soaps like pears and all,they are fooling the indian customers with lowest 'tfm' content.Google it for more info!",5

With 2 spoons for a cup of tea there is no taste at all it feels like we are having just hot water with sugar. It needs 3 spoons for a cup, to atleast get slight taste of tea. I took 500gm pack now it's getting difficult to even finish the pack and start with some new tea. I took this tea because my regular brand Wagh Bakri was not available. Such tasteless tea is really not expected from brand Tata.",1

2285,I like this tea. But sir you have charged Rs 400 but it is avilable in market  for Rs 320  or  325. Please give me the required refund.  I shall be thankful to you.,5
2220,"Reviewing CTC tea can be tricky: everyone has their own preferences. Flavour profiles that one has become accustomed to often determines how one reacts to a new tea.For the purpose of making milk tea,  this particular brand is quite good: a strong combination of good colour, definitely pleasing fragrance and taste that's firm but not too overpowering.This is a good option for someone used to tee leaves made by the likes of Wagh Bakri. This has slightly more liquor to it than the Wagh Bakhri and the fragrance spectrum is a bit wider.If you're the type who likes your Tata Agni and similar robust and bolder tea leaves then this may not be what you're looking for.It's price point is on the higher side and may be a factor for many. That said,  if you enjoy that one good cup a day,  it's a worthy buy-in.My recommendation: certainly worth a try especially if you like a good,  developed flavour in your cuppa.",4

1950,Purchased Himalaya baby lotion for my one year old baby... After applying this lotion her face became red and we could clearly sense that it was an allergy caused by using this baby lotion...

1702,"Someone like me had always fancied upon getting some of my hair getting coloured when I see some people with colored or highlighted hair.Going to parlor or salon has always been hard on budget if you are living in a working middle class family.Finally I decided to get 2 packets of this hair highlighter after doing some research and surfing various Youtube videos.Coming to this product let me review as under:Pros:1  Gives good color/highlights if kept for about 45 minutes. (note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home. I would rather suggest spending few bucks and get your hair highlighted in parlor or salon for better results.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! üëç",4
100,"Frankly I have ordered this product after seeing so many good reviews..and here is my honest review after using for about 15 days--Does not break my skin- feel light and mositurized- does nothing for my marks or uneven toneSo, the purpose of fading marks or making glowing skin is not at all entertained so far.Yet I want to wait till 1 bottle use. Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!",3

It is complete value for money",5
945,"Hi All,As I cut opened the pack I was really amazed by the ghee quality. We usually assume patanjali products to be  low/poor quality since it is manufactured indigenously or may be because we are already habitual of using Costly products. You may find the price hike too much of this Ghee, I can assure you it is because the quality is really authentic. I do not have the images of the ghee now. Ghee is thick, pale white in color. And taste so Delicious. The aroma is so authentic.It has long shelf life. However, I have recently started making Full cream cow milk ghee at home.Will definitely recommend everyone to try this Ghee.",5

I have tried Taj Mahal, Red label, RCM and many different others.I like my tea strong and for that you don't have to add too much of this tea. It is not just too strong tea, it tastes good. Most in my family like it and this is the one we are going to use from now on along with Red Label for those who like Red Label more.And Amazon, from time to time, provides good discounts on products and makes them affordable for all. Btw, it sells for 355 next door mall when Amazon is selling it for 385. I know shipping costs, so it is ok.",5

It has a very nice and mild scented fragrance. I tried it inside my car, washroom and kids room as well. It leaves the place very fresh and nice.Although, there is no way to check whether it kills the germs or not but still I think it worth to try once. All the freshners, which I had tried before, came with very hard scented and irritating smell. But this is very mild and soothing.One should give it a try for sure as it is pocket friendly too.",4

1644,This is not the same product as advertised. I received a Steax Vitariche gloss serum instead of Streax pro Vitagloss as the product name suggests. Called CS to get the refund and since i had closed my bank account since the order was placed i wanted the refund to come through amazon pay. However Amazon rep Aniket and the supervisor Krishna were absolutely unhelpful and went against common sense to keep telling me that the refund will only be processed to the closed bank account and the bank will issue me a DD. When i called them out on their lack of common sense they kept repeating themselves. Finally decided to give away the product than to deal with Amazon for a refund. This shows how base Amazon‚Äôs customer service is and a good sign for all to avoid using Amazon if you value your money and time.,1

Conclusion - Patanjalii is not upto the mark...,3
2589,be careful. the image is misleading. it looks like it is offering 3 diff sizes of talcum powder whereas the seller gives only one (large size). if you are expecting to receive all the 3 diff sizes of talcum powder then you are in for a big shock.

When i opened the box, to my disappointment i found the thin plastic that covers a new watch glass face is all crumpled up to a corner. I was scared thinking the glass face must be damaged, but thank God it wasnt the case. Also there's no dealer stamp in the warranty card.My take: if you really like what you see, go for it. And if you are scared to buy online then buy it from the brick mortar shops, cause its worth it.",2

It really does moisturize your skin. Perfect for dry skin, specially in harsh winter.I've very dry and sensitive skin so i need a very good moisturising  skin care routine specially in winter months. My sensitive skin does not agree with random products bought off the shelf. I tried this in 100ml tube as it's herbal and I liked as it really does moisturize my dry skin so I bought this 200ml pack from Amazon.I removed a star though as it's outlet is so big ,a very generous amount plops out in single pump and you end up finishing it up way faster as compared to other face wash( the 100ml tube had a very generous outlet too).",4

1357,Ok,5

So I moved online, it was even difficult to get one there also. However, after lots of attempt I got 1. After using this for shaving purpose I think it is equally good as antiseptic variety. It leaves a freshness felling after washing face with this. This leaves a refreshing fragrance if mixed with bathing water.

361,"The product is good. The only caveat (as I have noticed so far) is to be careful with the alarm. Don't keep stuff on it after switching the alarm on. Second, I think the alarm tone itself should change. It needs to be ALARMING. The volume needs to be a bit on the higher side as well. One can easily muffle the sound with a blanket type of fabric and make a getaway. That said, it is quite a sleek gadget. Definitely worth more than what one would be paying for. It's a bit heavy, but I guess that needs to be part of the ""package"" so to speak.",5

803,During this indefinite lockdown this paneer has definitely been a saviour.The best part is that the expiry date is almost 45 days. This helps to stock and store paneer and use it as and when need be which actually is not possible with any fresh dairy paneer.

299,The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it.

It is very strong the first couple of days and rest of the times it is just a light hint of the scent. Then the gel eventually crystallizes.I figured out a way for a 'juggad'. Basically I never take the gel pack out of the plastic cover. There is a hole at the top to hang individual packs for store displays that I cut. Then with scissors, I carefully make 3 slender cuts. This makes the scent come out soft and not too powerful. It lasts for almost 20 days this way. The violet fragrance (purple) lasts for 25 days with this.Hope this review is helpful.",4

927,"Sheer waste of money as the Milk got curdled on the last two occasions that I ordered.It appears that delivering the packets during this hot season without adequate precaution spoils the milk.Although the packet states that no refrigeration is required till opened, however it also mentions that the packets are to be stored in a cool place.Thus the careless transportation in an ordinary vehicle in hot weather is bound to have an adverse impact on the milk.",1
1462,"What a gem from an old and trusted Indian brand. And such great value for money.The fragrance is nice powdery scent which is refreshing without being overpowering. The soap‚Äôs cleansing is good, not great. But it has a nice creaminess which is far beyond its modest price. In fact, it has a nice natural creaminess, and not the slipperiness of a Dove. Also, it seems to long last. A clear winner and will be a regular feature on my bathing rack.",5
303,"Easy to operate.But installation is a head breaking thing. After repeated calls to Godrej customer care, finally they came after 20 days and charged 750 rupees for installation. Good for small stuff. Light weight hence it needs to be mounted in cupboard or wall otherwise it is light enough to be carried and run ;-) Best thing is that I got it in a deal 4200.",5

1922,Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you don't feel  creamy when you get out using this. It gives a smooth feeling to our skin and will not irritated your skin at all. This product is a lotion and not a moisturizer so it is not a replaced for that this is baby lotion too. It works very well for your skin.As this is not an oily lotion which will not make you sweat even in hot summer It  smells  good and leaves skin smooth afterwards.  Even though this is a baby lotion people with very sensitive skin can also use this one as it is good for damaged skin too. After using for many months i can say it rebuilds your skin.Himalaya is now not using Paraben for Baby lotion so the lotion is safe than before. This lotion is not greesy at all. Please go for Original product as duplicates are out there.,4

I tried setting the timer on 10,20 and 40min intervals but it sprays within seconds. Can‚Äôt even return the product now because it is out of return window. The fragnance is pretty good but can‚Äôt believe that the machinery of this product have timer issues in just less than a month of use. Totally not recommended if you are bot looking to buy this product every month.",1

2137,"As the pricing was highest for this product in the company range assumed that it would be the best color and flavor.However was disspointed as the flavor is similar to the cheaper leaf tea or even some good dust variety. Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure.",3
